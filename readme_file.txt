Hi this is Hamza Anis Registration No DHC-173:


You can directly view it from the link :https://homepage-design-delta.vercel.app/

or dowload the code but it will not work properly if you directly open it in 
browser because of proxy. you can download the repository and run through vs 
code live server extension it will work properly. I will fix 
the problem as soon as possible.

CSS tailwind is used through cdn that's why it is showing error in console 
just ignore it. The website will work properly

Thank You!
